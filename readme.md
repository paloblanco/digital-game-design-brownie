# Digital Game Design - Brownies
## An activity for badge 2 in the "Coding for Good" series for Brownies

This is a short activity meant to teach girls about how games are made and how they can be used for good.

## Guidance for troop leaders:
Please feel free to use the materials in the above link to conduct an activity to satisfy badge 2 in the "Coding for Good" series for Brownies. No attribution to me is needed.
To run a meeting with these materials, I suggest the following:

1. Prep:
    1. There is a pdf on the above web page that is meant to be a paper + crayons + coloring materials activity. I suggest printing 2-3 sheets per troop member. You can also find the pdf here: https://paloblanco.github.io/digital-game-design-brownie/assets/worksheet_game_design_brownie.pdf
    2. Part of the independent activity in this meeting guide is playing a video game that is embedded in the above web page. The web page can be loaded on any digital device: laptops, phones, or tablets. I had luck running the meeting on Amazon Fire 8 tablets. I recommend 1 digital device per 4 troop members at least; while half of them are doing the paper activity, the other half can pair off and trade the tablet back and forth.
2. Running the meeting:
    1. Opening - 10 minutes - The troop leader can read through the first few sections of the web page (opening, sections 1 and 2) and show the troop members pictures. I recommend you skim the material ahead of time just to get some talking points. The official guidance for this activity is listed below under **Official Guidance**
    2. Activities - split the members into two groups. They can spend 15 minutes on each activity. After 15 minutes, swap the groups.
        1. Activity 1 - Design a game: The instructions for this are listed on the web page. To repeat:
          - Each participant should get their own copy of the Game Design Document. Spend a few minutes and draw some ideas for your game!
              - Draw a picture of what it might look like.
              - Give it a name.
              - Describe what you might do in this game. Be as creative as you want! Don't be afraid to be inspired by your favorite books, movies, or other video games!
              After designing your game, let some of your friends look at your paper!
              - When you are looking at your friend's game, write down 1 thing you like, and 1 thing you think would be fun to add!
        2. Activity 2: Make a game level for your friend to play.
            - You can maximize the web game on the web page so that it takes up the whole computer screen. Girls can take turns designing a level to guide a girl scout through to save a cat. You may want to familiarize yourself with thhe game a bit so you can help troubleshoot.
            - If the game crashes or gets into an unrecoverable state, I recommend just refreshing the web page.
