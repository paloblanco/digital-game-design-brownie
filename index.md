## An activity for badge 2 in the "Coding for Good" series for Brownies

### Have you ever wondered how video games are made?
They are made by girls like you! It takes lots of different skill sets and people to make a digital game:
- **Programmers** tell a computer what to do by writing very specific instructions, called *code*, into a computer. Code is sort of like a recipe - computer know how to follow these instructions very closely.
    - How do computers know how to understand code? Grace Hopper was a pioneer in programming computers, and she helped build tools called *compilers* for the US Navy to let computers understand code.

    - Today, programmers like Katie Bouman use code to help us do things we have never done before, like take pictures of black holes!

- Games aren't just code, though. It takes artists, musicians, and game designers to make games come to life!

Today, let's learn a little about how games can be used for good and how they are made. Then, we will experiment with building and testing our own games!

### 1. Game design can be used for good!

Games can bring us together and help us to have fun, but that's not all they can do. Many people use games today to help teach people important things, to spread awareness about causes, and to help gather information that can be used to help doctors!

#### Games to help medicine
*Phylo* is a game made by researchers at McGill University. It is a fun puzzle game, but it also helps researchers collect data on our DNA to help cure diseases.

#### Games about being safe online
The United States Government uses digital games too! If you work for the US military, you will probably play games that help teach you about protecting important information about keeping information safe.

### 2. What kinds of tools are used to develop video games?

Lots of different tools are used to make digital games!

**Computers** are used to make the *code* for a game. A *programmer* tells the computer how characters will behave, what happens when someone pushes buttons, and how you win or lose.

### 3. Plan your own game!

### 4. Make your game better by testing and iterating.

### 5. Share your game!
